# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#Python is a simple, dynamic, general purpose, high-level programming language intended to be quick (to learn, use and understand) and has a very straight forward syntax.
#It was designed to make programs short and readable by avoiding unnecessary boiler plate (prepared code) code.
#Its syntax makes it possible to express concepts using fewer lines of code than would be possible in C++ or Java.
#Python supports object oriented, imperative and functional / procedural programming paradigms. Comes pre-loaded with a large and comprehensive standard library, so one does not need to depend on external libraries most of the time.
#Other key features include automatic memory management and dynamic type system (strongly typed).
#Python compiles its code into byte code and then executes it in a virtual machine. This means that precompiled code is portable between platforms.
#Python is a very efficient language.
#This is made possible because of the fact that much of its activity is done at the C level. It is in effect just a layer on top of C.

#Python 2 is more widely used and supported.
#Python 3 is more semantically correct, and supports newer features.

#In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses.

#Integrated DeveLopment Environment (IDLE) serves as an IDE for Python. It was designed to be simple and clutter free and is suitable for beginners.
#It comes bundled with Python installation, so no extra installations are required to have IDLE working.

#Python enforces correct indentation of the code by making the indentation part of the syntax.
#Code blocks are identified by the level of indentation.
#An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. This feature ensures the code is visually pleasant to read.
#Being dynamically typed, variables do not need to be declared with a type.
#The def keyword is used to define functions or methods.
#Comments start with a pound (#) character and continue till EOL.
#Statements terminate at EOL, no semi colon characters are required to indicate EOL.
#Code blocks do not need termination.

#Being a true object oriented language, Python is dynamically typed and not statically typed unlike many languages.
#Variables do not need to be declared.
#Every variable is an object.

#Similar to Arrays, Python has lists which can be used to store and retrieve values in an iterative manner.
#Basic arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/) can be used with numbers and follow the general BODMAS concept for order of operations.

print "Hello World" #This is a print function

import keyword

#Variables and Types:

myIntVar = 42 #declaring any variable
myFloatVar = 42.42
myStringVar = "Forty Two" #strings are declared inside quotations
myNumberString = "42" #python sees this as a string instead of number because of the quotation

#Using operators with strings:
#Additional operators, + can be used to concatenate two or more strings.

#The index(0 method can be used to get the index(position) of the first occurence a character within a string.

#count() method can be used to get the number of times a character occurs within a string.

print myString.count("a")

#By providing the start and end indexes one can easily extract a substring within a string.

print myString [3:15]

#The upper() and lower() method can be used to convert a string to all uppercase or lowercase.

#The startswith() and endswith() method can be used to check if a string starts/ends with the specifies string.

print myString.startswith("son!")

#Using the % operator, we can format a given set of variables together with a format string (normal text + argument specifiers).
#Argument specifiers are a set of special symbols which begin with a % sign like %s, %d etc. which indicate the type of data in the respective variable.
# %s=String %f=Floating point numbers %nf=Floating point numbers with n digits to the right of the deciaml point %x/%X=Hexadecimal integers(lowercase or uppercase)

#You can import modules

import math
print math.sqrt(16)  # => 4

# You can get specific functions from a module
from math import ceil, floor
print ceil(3.7)  # => 4.0
print floor(3.7)   # => 3.0

# You can import all functions from a module.
# Warning: this is not recommended
from math import *

# You can shorten module names
import math as m
math.sqrt(16) == m.sqrt(16)   # => True
# you can also test that the functions are equivalent
from math import sqrt
math.sqrt == m.sqrt == sqrt  # => True

# Python modules are just ordinary python files. You
# can write your own, and import them. The name of the
# module is the same as the name of the file.

# You can find out which functions and attributes
# defines a module.
import math

#Generators help you make lazy code

def double_numbers(iterable):
    for i in iterable:
        yield i + i

#A generator creates values on the fly.
#Instead of generating and returning all values at once it creates one in each
#iteration. This means values bigger than 15 wont be processed in double_numbers.
#Note: xrange is a generator that does the same thing range does.
#Creating a list 1-900000000 would take lot of time and space to be made.
#xrange creates an xrange generator object instead of creating the entire list like range does.
#We use a trailing underscore in variable names when we want to use a name that would normally collide with a python keyword

xrange_ = xrange(1, 900000000)

# will double all numbers until a result >=30 found
for i in double_numbers(xrange_):
    print i
    if i >= 30:
        break
